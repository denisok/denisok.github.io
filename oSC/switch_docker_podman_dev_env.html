## PMM
- [Grafana based interface](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management)
- [https://github.com/percona/pmm](https://github.com/percona/pmm)
- docker as main distribution method
- also supports different Clouds

Note:
Go to the marketing link
- show nice picture how it looks
- talk about those aspects of mon, qan, management

## PMM development
- Go lang, local builds, start in container
- [docker-compose](https://github.com/percona/pmm-managed/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) to run the server
- [docker-compose](https://github.com/percona/pmm/blob/main/agent/docker-compose.yml) to run test environment
- [Makefiles](https://github.com/percona/pmm-managed/blob/main/Makefile#L12) with docker exec
- [gorelease](https://github.com/percona/mongodb_exporter/blob/main/.goreleaser.yml) to build some other bin/containers
- [docker-compose](https://github.com/percona/mongodb_exporter/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) for test those
- [scripts](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/pmm-submodules/blob/PMM-2.0/build/bin/build-server-rpm#L102) and [docker build](https://github.com/Percona-Lab/pmm-submodules/blob/PMM-2.0/build/bin/build-server-docker#L32) to build release image

Note:

Get to the links and explain:
- development of the app is not easy
- dev testing that is hard
- devcontainer for VSCode is also there
- external dependencies as exporters has their own builds and testing
- creating release build is even more complicated
- CI/CD even not discussed here - quite a topic by itself

## Why
- development environment in containers
- unlock from hardcoded tools
- rootless, daemonless
- opportunity to think about more general approach for OSS members

Note:

In development we use containers quite extensively to run client-server application as well as different DBs. To make that env as close as possible to the real one we need this kind of isolation.
Historically PMM uses docker quite extensively, for build and test environment. docker-compose is also the must.

I suppose during early PMM development docker was quite popular and till this day had better compatibility: mac, windows.

Also the main distribution method is docker.

Being a fun of podman approach I didn't want to install docker in a first place and asked myself if I could use podman instead.

But more generally, it is more a question on how to have reliable dev environment to support different platforms.

For example OSS: to get more contributions from ppl that could use different tools.

In this talk I will share my experience trying to understand if there any way of more general development approach to environment on example of using podman in a docker first dev env.

## Podman

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI ([Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/)) Containers

POD MANager

Check out also [Kubernetes Podcast](https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/164-podman/) to learn more about `podman` and listen to it's creators.


Note:
- when docker requires daemon running, podman is just a cli talking to oci runtime
- rootless from the start
- compatible with docker cli
- it is not just container abstraction but also pod
- there quite a lot of ppl in openSUSE that promote podman for a long time
- enterprise support push by RH
- rapid development
- OCI standardization

## setup is easy

```sh
$ sudo zypper install podman
```
If you need docker-compose no problemo:
```sh
$ sudo zypper install docker-compose
$ systemctl --user start podman.socket
```

Note:
docker-compose is just a tool that talks to the socket, so it is fine
As we seen in the examples for PMM I would need it anyway.
I don't particularly like compose spec, and it was confusing for me to jump from 2 to 3 version, like container start sequence and other incompatible features.

## kube generate/play
- podman supports k8s manifests
- could generate those and start them
- gives you possibility to use it in k8s
- is it better interface than compose?

Note:
Along many features, I would like to highlight k8s compatibility.
Last time I tried it wasn't full, I had issues with networking.
But as better interface and potential - it is great.

## Let's roll

```sh
$ alias docker=podman
```

Note:
Lets try to replace docker with podman.
I still need docker-compose, and that is installed, as well as podman socket
I would like to run it as the regular user

## DOCKER_HOST
```sh
$ make env-up

  File "/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/docker/transport/unixconn.py", line 30, in connect
    sock.connect(self.unix_socket)

$ DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock make env-up
```

Note:
docker-compose that is used to bring up environment couldn't connect to the docker daemon and thus failing. There is an env var to point to the right socket to talk to so lets find out the socket path and set it.

Set that var in your environment (.bashrc or similar) or I set it in the current session

## short-name resolution
```sh
$ make env-up
Pulling pmm-managed-server ... error

ERROR: for pmm-managed-server  failed to resolve image name: short-name resolution enforced but cannot prompt without a TTY
ERROR: failed to resolve image name: short-name resolution enforced but cannot prompt without a TTY

$ DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/podman/podman.sock PMM_SERVER_IMAGE=docker.io/perconalab/pmm-server:dev-latest make env-up
```

Note:
The way to go is to alias names for example in /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/001-shortnames-den.conf.
Or use full qualified names.
This is another non-standard assumption that everything is in one docker hub repo.

## security-opt parameter
```sh
$ make env-up
...
ERROR: for pmm-managed-server  Cannot create container for service pmm-managed-server: fill out specgen: invalid --security-opt 1: "seccomp:unconfined"
https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/7dabcbd7bcf78f3b5d310ed547801106da382618/pkg/specgenutil/specgen.go#L544
```
here it is:
```yaml
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
```
Podman understands `seccomp=unconfined` docker should be happy as well, as it support both `:` and `=`
* https://github.com/docker/cli/blob/9de1b162f/cli/command/container/opts.go#L673


Note:
Looks like devs weren't sure which one is correct or there were no standard on the date `:` was added. But looks like `=` is a correct one. So we need to test it with docker and just change.

## Makefile and alias
```sh
$ make env-up
...
Creating pmm-managed-server ... done
compose.parallel.feed_queue: Pending: set()
compose.parallel.parallel_execute_iter: Finished processing: <Service: pmm-managed-server>
compose.parallel.feed_queue: Pending: set()
docker exec -it --workdir=/root/go/src/github.com/percona/pmm-managed pmm-managed-server .devcontainer/setup.py
make: docker: No such file or directory
make: *** [Makefile:12: env-devcontainer] Error 127

$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/podman /usr/bin/docker
``` 

Note:
all before was docker-compose up, and here we come to docker commands in Makefile.
So we can't just alias it in bash, but need a link:
`$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/podman /usr/bin/docker`

Other way to do it is to use some variable in the Makefile to be able to take executable as a parameter.

## Success
```sh
$ make env-up
...
> supervisorctl start pmm-managed
pmm-managed: started
Done in 129.057330132
```
- it didn't take long to workaround everything
- goreleaser for mongodb_exporter worked fine
- test env with docker-compose also worked with minor tweaks

Note:
for goreleaser you also need to pass socket as a parameter

docker-compose that we have also have `links` which weren't recognized by podman and actually obsolete.
Another spec issue for compose.

## SELinux
- `:Z` option for volumes that you want to use locally and in container

```yaml
- .:/root/go/src/github.com/percona/pmm-managed:Z
```

- `:z` option for test env so containers could share volumes with each other

Note:
In dev some volumes are used both locally and in container to spin new changes.

In testing env some of the containers could use same volumes for startup scripts for example.

## Release builds
- PMM has tightly coupled [infrastructure in container](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4b5d53d6084d15d3ad0cfa710d8d13d6097819d69914fa5ca447dfa9dcd4b7f7/68747470733a2f2f646f63732e706572636f6e612e636f6d2f706572636f6e612d6d6f6e69746f72696e672d616e642d6d616e6167656d656e742f5f696d616765732f504d4d5f4172636869746563747572655f436c69656e745f5365727665722e6a7067)
- when development builds are based on existing container
- release is done from sources and has many components

## Minor tweaks
- build is based on bash scripts
- it uses docker to build binaries and rpms
  - `--userns=keep-id` for correct permission during rpm build in containers
- same issues as in dev builds (`:Z`, names and etc)

Note:

## Ansible
- needed as we support not just containers but Cloud images as well
- install needed packages
- provision services inside of container
- hardcoded values `when: ansible_virtualization_type == "docker"`
  - `ansible-playbook -e ansible_virtualization_type=docker`

Note:
Ansible version is quite old, and not yet know about podman. In modern versions there is `container` abstraction.

I had no other way but to change Dockerfile to run it with parameters and detect podman/docker in a script to choose what file to use.

					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
## ngnix
- config that is used in container has privileged ports
- ansible was starting ngnix during build
- this is general PMM issue and will be fixed with rootless container

## Summary
- cli is compatible
- legacy artifacts along the way
  - deprecated compose specs
  - short name resolutions
- good parametrization would make it work with any compatible cli

Note:

cli compatibility is a very nice interface, compose spec should be the same but k8s manifest are probably the better way

Shouldn't be cli dependant:
- docker
- podman
- nerdctl
- devcontainer cli

Scripts are much more flexible but always custom

Makefile are cumbersome to parametrize, hit me with a link of good practice

## Tools to automate
- [Dev container](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/blob/main/docs/specs/devcontainer-reference.md)
- [devcontainer cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli)
- any others?

Note:
tried to setup VSCode in flatpak to support podman, I spent and hour and abandoned it.
But for ppl that use VSCode it is good way to not exit IDE.

From other side ppl use different editors and IDE:
- vim
- GoLand
- others

It also a question to have set of tools:
- dev env has it's own
- release build another
- ci/cd another

scripts are more flexible in this regard to reuse in different stages?
Good parametrization is the answer.

					<section data-markdown>

## what about k8s
- kind, k3s, minikube, minishift
- another set of env to run
- `podman play kube` looks promising

Note:
I our project we also have DBaaS and thus we also need k8s environment.
Zoo of tools

play kube looks interesting if we look from automation around one set of standards "manifests"

imagine you need VMs and could use kata containers, KubeVirt
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
## next steps
- parametrize all the steps for more general container cli
- build in a container for dev
- devcontainer to use same set of tools
- explore k8s manifests as better deployment specs

Note:
dev env in container to start on any system any time:
- better onboarding
- enabling oss development

as example I have very nice experience with csi-hostpath plugin, when `make container` just worked with podman.
It did required Go to build though :(

minikube cli I love - detects a lot of things, provide instructions

The dream is to have all the steps fully containerized:
- to avoid side effects of unclean env
- minimum set of tools to use:
  - podman, toolbox
  - flatpak
- enable everyone with consistent dev env
