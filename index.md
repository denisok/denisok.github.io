# Denys Kondratenko

I am someone who proactively solves complex issues (technical, organizational, and leadership), build awesome technical teams, and has a passion for technology.

In the course of my career path, I had the pleasure of hiring and work with very talented engineers and build teams of them to build products and solve issues in a number of technological domains and industries:
  * automation systems
  * industrial machine manufacturers
  * embedded
  * telecoms
  * high-performance computing
  * distributed file system
  * cloud
  * distributed storage
  * monitoring
  * DBaaS

Saying that I still very much like to contribute to technology by writing code and creating solutions so I could better lead the technical team.
So yeah, I am an Engineering Manager with a big emphasis on "Engineering" everything effectively: code, processes, and teams.

As a person, I welcome positive challenges and changes and am not afraid of negative ones. I like sports and tried many different one's over the course of my life, currently enjoying CrossFit, running, swimming, and bouldering. My hobby over my life is traveling and especially hiking.

I am married and have awesome twins :)
